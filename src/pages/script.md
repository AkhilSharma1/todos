After  experiencing the education system from world's  top universities which strive to teach their students latest technologies relevant to the industry ,
 we came to the realization that there is lot of need for such content which are not only rigorous and coding-oriented but are also
 future proof to ensure a high demand in tech industry for years to come. Currently, more that 80% of engineering graduates in India
 are unfit for employment. We now aim to change this by bridging the skill gap between what the colleges teach and what the 
 industries require.

 We take a lot of effort to ensure  that our courses are always up-to-date in latest trends in multiple technologies and also rigorous and fun with
 50% of our course duration dedicated to writing code. To that end, , we have introduced  programs in latest technologies such as:
  - Cross-platform mobile app development with React Native and Google's Flutter
  - Web technologies such as React, Angular and Vue
  - Machine learning , Artifical Intelligence and Data Science
  as well as Blockchain.
